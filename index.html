    <h4><b>Project Abstract</b></h4>
    <p>Depth estimation and 3D reconstruction from images is a core technology used in various applications such as, film, computer graphics, earth observation, and medical imaging. There are two main categories of 3D reconstruction: active methods, which interact physically with the object, and pas- sive methods, that measure the radiance or irradiance of the object with a sensor.</p>
    <p>There is an abundance of 3D reconstruction techniques using passive methods. However, the goal of achieving high-quality 3D reconstruction using these techniques has posed a considerable Computer Vision challenge. The main reason is because they assume the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of materials are Lambertian (diffuse) leading to discontinuities in their reconstructions. However, the approach Helmholtz Stereopsis does not assume the BRDF of an ob- ject, yet this approach alone produces lower quality depth maps compared with other passive approaches such as epipolar plane image volumes.
        From a review of literature on this subject, it is evident that a gap exists with current methods and neither Helmholtz Stereopsis nor epipolar planes offer a complete solution. Therefore, the project detailed in this paper focuses on improving passive 3D reconstruction methods by combining Helmholtz Stereopsis with epipolar plane images to form a novel approach to achieve high-quality 3D reconstruction of complex materials.
        As part of the project a novel image acquisition technique was created to produce a dataset of 1200 images within Blender. Using these images disparity maps were calculated using epipolar plane image volumes eliminating unknown depth variables in Helmholtz reciprocity equations, thereby enabling the calculation of object surface normals from only two linear path pairs. The results obtained from four objects showed an average mean difference of normal angles from their true value of 45.09 degrees with an average standard deviation of 9.22. This best standard deviation achieved was 6.8.
        From an overall project evaluation perspective, the project successfully achieved the four objectives it set, notwithstanding that the results achieved by the project were not perfect. The results were affected by the presence of occlusions, reflections, and the object point matching algorithm used. The results furthermore showed that the approach used suffered from a poor foundation of disparity maps that affected the outcome. However, it is evident that the combination of Helmholtz Stereopsis and epipolar plane images can form a novel approach to extract surface normals. Thereby, contributing to filling the identified gap in the literature and current passive 3D reconstruction approaches.
        This paper further proposes another novel method for future work that could fully integrate Helmholtz Stereopsis into epipolar plane image volumes. This would allow for reflective materials to be modelled and their normals calculated.
