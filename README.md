# Thesis-3D-scene-reconstruction-from-complex-materials
This thesis involves using a novel approach to scene reconstruction from 2D images by using Helmholtz Stereopsis and Epipolar Plane Images.
The code in the repository is used to implement Helmholtz Stereopsis on a specific data aquistion method, more info can be found at https://limeycode.github.io/hello-world/
